MoonTree is a mobile wallet for Android and iPhone for Evrmore and Ravencoin.

The github repository for the MoonTree project is at:
    "https://github.com/moontreeapp/moontree"

MoonTree will soon be replaced with the next-generation improved wallet, so it has been removed from the Android Playstore.

If for any reason you still need access to the MoonTree Android wallet, the binary "apk" file is archived here in the "Releases" section for downloading and can be side-loaded onto an Android phone.
